# latex-assignment
Modern LaTeX assignment template.

##Overview
This is a modern template for college assignment applicable mostly for undergraduate students. The template is built on *paper* class, details of which can be found at https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/paper?lang=en.
However, this template changes the *"look-and-feel"* of "paper" class to suit regular needs of college students. I originally made this for my assignments, but I believe this template can be used by more people. The more, the merrier.

####About *paper* class
Paper class is a highly underrated class, perhaps since most publishers require the documents in their proprietary format. However, there are more novel uses, like these, possible. 

####Version
