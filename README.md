# latex-assignment
Modern LaTeX assignment template.

## Overview
This is a modern template for college assignment applicable mostly for undergraduate students. The template is built on *paper* class, details of which can be found at https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/paper?lang=en.
However, this template changes the *"look-and-feel"* of "paper" class to suit regular needs of college students. While working on my assignment submissions, I got struck at various roadblocks with regard to design. Adding headers, a suitable introduction, etc. were getting really difficult. I needed a template that could be suitably modified and was on LaTeX (because I was getting bored of MS-Word). So, I decided to work on something. Thus, I modified an original class and got something new. I made this for my own assignments, but I believe this template can be used by more people. The more, the merrier. :D

#### About *paper* class
Paper class is a highly underrated class, perhaps since most publishers require the documents in their proprietary format. However, there are more novel uses, like these, possible.
